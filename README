Tool for cutting accurate SMT stencils on a Graphtec cutter (e.g. Silhouette Cameo or Portrait) from gerber files.  Techniques include separately drawn line segments (no complex paths), antibacklash, drag-knife-angle "training", and multiple passes.  This produces stencils usable down to approximately 0.5 mm pitch (QFP/QFN) and 0201 discrete components, or perhaps even slightly better; but it is slower than normal cutting.

GUI:

An GUI has been provided by jesuscf (see the dangerousprototypes.com thread linked above).  It allows interactive selection of the input Gerber file, parameters, and cutting operations.  To use it, run the file g2g_gui.py.

Also thanks to this web page (Cathy Sexton) for inspiration:

Her cutter seems to be quite a bit better than mine was out of the box.  With Silhouette's default software my 0.5 mm pitch pads were distorted to the point of unusability.
